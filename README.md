# 🧑‍🍳 Flavour Fusion — AI Recipe Blog Generator

Hey there! 👋  

**Flavour Fusion** is an AI-powered web application that generates complete recipe blog posts in seconds using Google's Gemini AI model.

Users simply enter a recipe idea, choose the desired blog length, and the app automatically creates a structured, professional recipe article — including introduction, ingredients, cooking steps, tips, serving suggestions, and storage instructions.

To make the experience fun, the app also displays a random cooking joke while the AI is generating the content 😄
